**Justification for Improvements**

- **Scalability**: The schema uses indexed columns (e.g., brand_user_id, transaction_date) and supports partitioning for large tables like Transactions and Points, ensuring efficient handling of high transaction volumes.
- **Flexibility**: Supports multiple point-earning mechanisms (transaction-based and non-transaction-based), diverse reward types, and targeted campaigns.
- **Integration**: Includes brand_user_id and brand_transaction_id for seamless integration with your brand's core systems.
- **Tiered Loyalty**: The Loyalty_Tiers table allows for a tiered system to incentivize higher engagement.
- **Auditability**: The Points table provides a clear history of all point activities, while the Transactions table ensures accurate tracking of transaction statuses.
- **Campaign Management**: Structured fields like target_transaction_types and target_user_segments enable precise campaign targeting.

This schema is designed to meet your brand's current needs while remaining adaptable to future enhancements, such as point expiry rules or additional reward types. It balances complexity with performance, ensuring the loyalty app can scale alongside your brand's growth.
